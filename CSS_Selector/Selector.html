<p>Whiskey embodies everything you'd expect from a one year old Alaskan Husky! He is full of energy and dramatic talents. He loves to be near his people and he does very well with other dogs his size. He is great about going in his crate, he will voice his displeasure when you leave the room, but will eventually quiet and rest. He knows some basic commands but would certainly benefit from a beginning obedience class. He can get overly excited and will jump up on people and doors; We are in the beginning stages of teaching him to 'sit' before exiting a door. He needs a home who will be diligent about exercising him. Backyard time is not enough for this active boy. He needs daily walks and would probably make a good running companion. </p>

<figcaption>Breed: Siberian Husky Mix</figcaption>
<p>Hi, new friend! I’m Mulaney! Like that comedian John Mulaney, but cuter! I’m a very goofy and silly dog once I get comfortable, so I’m probably funnier, too! I’m very perceptive and observant for such a young guy, so I like to take my time to make sure I fully understand my surroundings. I am very eager to meet my new family and show them how sweet and wonderful I am. I’m pretty sure this could be you; so if you agree, let’s get the adoption application started for me, Mulaney!</p>

<h3>Ruby</h3>

<p>Hello! I'm Ruby. I'm a playful and social gal looking for a family to call my own. I had a bum knee, but the vets took care of it for me. I'm not particularly enjoying the boring parts of recovering, and I can't wait to be back on my feet again! Maybe I'll never run the Iditarod, but I'm sure I'll be able to participate in fun explorations and activities that most families would enjoy. I've still got a bit of puppy-play in me - perhaps even rambunctiousness - so I would do better with bigger folks who can handle my enthusiasm. And maybe a playmate. What do you think? Is there room in your family for a gorgeous red - Ruby?! Then apply for me right away!</p>

<p>My name is Coal, but I am anything but naughty.... or Coal colored! I'm actually a very friendly doggo searching for my forever family! I enjoy the company of other doggos, big or small,  and I haven't yet met a hooman I don't like! I'm actually quite gentle with the little hoomans... they are so cute and make great pets! I like to be near them at supper time because they usually need someone to clean up after them,  and I'm pretty great at that! I will even clean off the counters! And if my hoomans leave, I'll be content to relax in my crate... not sure why no one wants me to clean the kitchen while they're gone?! So if you'd like a cleaning buddy who enjoys the outdoors and knows some tricks, make sure you enter my name, Coal, on your application!</p>
